# qsub_slurm
This is a light convertor from qsub to sbatch.

# Aims
The main aim was to create a light wrapper to use dti-tk with slurm. 
By default, dti-tk has been written to use SGE and qsub submission system.
The "qsub_slurm" bash script convert some of the qsub argument to be able to submit them with slurm and sbatch.
